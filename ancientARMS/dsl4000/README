nc-firstrun.tgz is an NFS root directory that's bootable on a Pace DSL4000 (and
probably other Acorn ARM7500FE NC's with Ethernet) - you'll have to configure
the IP on the box accordingly (hold down select when booting the DSL4000 to get
the settings menu) which is all standardish IPv4 stuff that I should go into
but am a tad too lazy to at the moment.

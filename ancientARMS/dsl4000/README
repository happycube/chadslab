nc-firstrun.tgz is an NFS root directory that's bootable on a Pace DSL4000 (and
probably other Acorn ARM7500FE NC's with Ethernet) - you'll have to configure
the IP on the box accordingly (hold down select when booting the DSL4000 to get
the settings menu) which is all standardish IPv4 stuff that I should go into
but am a tad too lazy to at the moment.

Note that I don't have it opening the NFS directory yet so it's not fully useful,
I just wanted to snapshot something that booted ;)  I'm hoping to netboot an
older Linux and/or NetBSD next...

Some other notes:

- The DSL4000 is closer to an Acorn NC than a Bush box - it has ethernet 
  and PS/2 mouse+keyboard, but does not have VGA out.

- There's also an MPEG2 decoder with ROM modules for it, so there might be a
  way to use it to play video.

- I followed https://heyrick.eu/assembler/resources/bushstb.html and changed
  the file locations to point to NFS::NFSBoot.$ 

- The posted version doesn't run DeskStart,fea so you'll need to hit F12
  and run "Filer_OpenDir NFS::NFSBoot.$" to see the NFS folder.
